# Identifying the Causes of Alzheimer’s Disease within Brain Sections

To diagnose Alzheimer’s disease a pathologist has to go through the timely
and bias process of identify plaques and tangles within the Hippocampus. In
order to speed up this process and standardise the diagnosis, a system to
identify plaques and tangles needs to be built. This has been achieved using a
Visual Bag of Words and a Gaussian SVM classifier which utilises SURF feature
extraction to classify both the plaques and tangles. Unfortunately because of
limitations with accessing labelled image data, the system has yet to be fully
evaluated. However with a small image set with estimated labels, the system
was able to classify plaques and tangles with an accuracy of 88%.
